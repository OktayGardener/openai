Generate stuff you can track that exist in the text (that occurs either implicitly or explicitly), or after analysing it, that can be represented by numerical values or binary values, using the syntax [fieldname:: value]. Describe each fieldname and value that you generate and what the meaning of these values are, and give a source of where the values come from.
The generated data has to have either binary values (✅, ❌) or numerical.
Examples include [daily-note::✅], [shower::✅], [meditation::✅], [projectA::4], [money-spent::300] and [dinner::✅].
