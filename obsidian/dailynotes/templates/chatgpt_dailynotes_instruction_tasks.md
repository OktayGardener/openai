Identify and define any implicit or explicit todo's or tasks found in the text, and output them as a list, either completed or not done, with a fitting date. The creation date of the text is today, so be sure to use today's date when generating dates for tasks. In order to identify implicit tasks in the text, you can look for any statements that imply a task needs to be done or a reminder needs to be set. Remember, you are an assistant and a scrum master, you control the calendar and you need to act as a scheduler for a person and should always give out feasible dates for everything. Verify that the dates are correct by looking at today's date, the context of the text, what the text explicitly and implicitly says.

Syntax: - [<x | >] <Task Text> <⏫|🔼> 📅 <Due/Assigned/Created Date> <✅| > <Completed Date>
Following are some examples of how these should be represented:
- [ ] Climb a tree ⏫ 📅 2023-02-27
- [x] Buy herbs 🔼 📅 2023-02-28 ✅ 2023-02-288
