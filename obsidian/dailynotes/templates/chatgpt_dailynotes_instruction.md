Use the following text and template in order to put the text into correct parts of the template.
Output in markdown format.
Every section of the generated text should look the same and have the same amount of parts.
The same text can also belong to multiple different parts and should be added to every part it can belong to, not just the most fitting one.
All notes belong to notes for example, but can also be a random note and an important note.

Here are some examples of obsidian tasks,
- [ ] Climb a tree ⏫ 📅 2022-02-27
- [x] Buy herbs 🔼 📅 2022-02-28 ✅ 2022-02-28
- [ ] Buy Q-Tips ⏫ 📅 2022-02-28
- [x] Overdue 🔼 📅 2022-02-27 ✅ 2022-02-28
- [x] I did a this! 📅 2022-02-26 ✅ 2022-02-28

Please take the text, find tasks, and transform them into obsidian tasks, with the same format as the example. Take the role of an assistant and do your best to plan due dates for all tasks.

On top of that, generate tags for each subsection and section, with an accompanying emoji, and specify them as '🏷️ tags: #tag😁 #anothertag✅ #athirdtag📃' at the end of the subsection, for all sections. Generate tags even if it's an empty area.
