Task:
Use the note data which represents a note explaining everything on the individuals mind and what they expect to accomplish during the day. The document is not structured, and the task is to create a structured markdown document from the note, create lists, find interesting data and generating tags for each section. A template is provided that must be used to create the relevant markdown sections for the generated document with respect to the note text. Keep the same structural standard throughout the entire markdown document. Map and move/add sentences (text) to all fitting sections. The output should consist of a lot of the same information in different sections, it is expected. The output should contain a lot of a lot of lists.

Follow the following rules for structuring this document.

Format of the generated document:
Lists/Tasks/Lists/Todo/Todo's/Todos:
Following are some examples of how tasks should be represented:
- [ ] Climb a tree ⏫ 📅 2022-02-27
- [x] Buy herbs 🔼 📅 2022-02-28 ✅ 2022-02-28
- [ ] Buy Q-Tips ⏫ 📅 2022-02-28
- [x] Overdue 🔼 📅 2022-02-27 ✅ 2022-02-28
- [x] I did a this! 📅 2022-02-26 ✅ 2022-02-28

Data found in the text:
In the generated document, find statistics, inferred data, underlying data, latent data, and interesting data, and inline, define it with this syntax.

Form structured data in the following manner: (fieldname:: value)

For example:
Wake up at 6 am (wakeup::6am)
Take a cold shower (shower::✅)
Meditate for 10 minutes (meditation::✅)
Work on project A for 1 hour (projectA::1)
Have dinner: grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and rice (dinner:: grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, and rice)

Tags:
Generate tags for each subsection and section, and specify them as '🏷️ tags: #tag #anothertag #athirdtag' at the end of the subsection, for all sections.
Generate tags even if it's an empty area.

Text:
I woke up at around 18 after going to sleep at around 12. I was the definition of gone man. I was so gone. I woke up twice to mobile sounds other than that I slept well.

I have been working on Obsidian notes and right before I went to bed (and somehow made chatGPT crash multiple times and had it ask itself self reference questions like “What is GPT-3.5?” as a reply 😂, I was working on tags.

I am done with tags and the solution was to 1. Not focus on date tags and let them dictate much because if they do it will be a project on its own. 2. Generate colors for tags given a palette found on color hunt. Sick website btw.

I am stopping doing cosmetics things now for obsidian and will focus on the views I need and the integration with the template I found. The template wasn’t even all that. There’s another one I’ve downloaded I want to check out and see if it’s drawing in any content that could be useful.

What I need in obsidian now:

A weekly view. I need to get an overview of all the tasks and what’s happening this week with me, so I can reflect on a higher level. Add tasks, logs, and other useful information such as trackers and a table showing if you’ve inputted data/have data so I can get an overview.
A monthly view of tasks, trackers.
Question maybe before creating these views:
What the hell do I do with all the content I have?
(I’m seriously going to ask chatGPT about this) What can I do with it in obsidian?
Why am I storing/logging this?

Maybe think about this for each area so you can incorporate it into the other views and get summaries or so.

Create weekly view document: Goals, Achievements (Log generates achievements),
Create Mental Health Overview Document
Create Ideas/Achievements/Goals. Given that you had these ideas and goals, what did you actually achieve? Incorporate TODO lists as well here to get a full overview.
So current setup is:
(daily note) Morning: Write daily scribble - let chatGPT create the rest of the document.
(daily note) Throughout the day: Log. Log your activities and what you’re done. Todo list/Log will be in center.
(Daily note) Write down any learnings.
(Weekly note manual) Migrate learnings to structured Learning sub vault.
Everything else should be generated and collected in views. Then it’s just about getting an overview of your patterns and learning more about how you work and adding this maybe to 'Me".
