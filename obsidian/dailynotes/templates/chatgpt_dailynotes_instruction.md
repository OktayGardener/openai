Task:
Convert an unstructured note into a structured markdown document by analyzing the text and understanding its underlying meaning by implicit mentions or by using deduction, based of a template containing generated blocks of data and tags. Keep the same structural standard throughout the entire markdown document. The creation date of the text is today, so be sure to use today's date when creating dates for tasks and other lists. Remember, for that part you are an assistant, you control the calendar and you need to act as a scheduler for a person.

Follow the following rules for structuring this document.

Format of the generated Lists/Tasks/Lists/Todo/Todo's/Todos/Goals/Achievements/Notes (if appliccable):
Syntax: - [<x | >] <Task Text> <⏫|🔼> 📅 <Date>
Following are some examples of how these should be represented:
- [ ] Climb a tree ⏫ 📅 2023-02-27
- [x] Buy herbs 🔼 📅 2023-02-28 ✅ 2023-02-28

Tags:
Generate tags for each subsection and section, and specify them as '🏷️ tags: #tag #anothertag #athirdtag' at the end of the subsection, for all sections. Always generate taks on a new line.
Generate tags even if it's an empty area.
